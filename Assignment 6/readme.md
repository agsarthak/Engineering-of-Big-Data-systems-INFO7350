Wikispecies lab with the XML files.

•Pick a (big) categorical dataset from the UCI dataset or another repository, and run the Winnow algorithm on it
 –Winnow classification is designed specifically for binary classification problems (independent variables are binary)
 –But it can be applied to problems where one or more x-variables are categorical
   •For example, suppose one predictor variable is “color” and can take one of three possible values: “red,” “green,” or “blue”
   •If you use 1-of-N encoding, red becomes (1, 0, 0), green becomes (0, 1, 0), blue becomes (0, 0, 1) …

•What’s the dataset size after which the algorithm becomes unwieldy?

•How could you improve on the Winnow?

•The “best” 3 dataset experiments or improvements are going to be presented in class!

Other than the wikispecies lab, you also need to understand and run the winnow on vscode, *AND* apply it to a NEW dataset of your choice. The goal here is for you to start looking for datasets, either on the UCI, Kaggle, or other web sites. I also expect you to do an interesting prediction based on the dataset of your choice. For example, who is going to win the next presidential election?
